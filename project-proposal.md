# Capstone 2 - Project Proposal

1. For this project I will be using React on the front end and Node JS and Express for the back end. I will be using tailwind css for styling.
2. I am going to make an evenly focused full-stack application.
3. This project will be a website.
4. The goal of this project will be to provide people interested in fitness and strength training templates for workout programs specific to their goals.
5. The people that I expect to visit the app will be people that are new to fitness or are looking for a new fitness program tailored to their goals.
6. I am looking to obtain data from an API that has a large selection of exercises with data related to each exercise like target muscles, video demonstrations or gifs of each exercise, equipment needed, etc.
7. a. My database schema will have a "users" table containing login information and personal information related to their fitness goals, a "workout" table that stores data related to a users saved workout program, a "user_workout" table that references both the user and their specific workout.  
   b. Issues that may arise are potentially not having all the information needed for the app like video demonstrations, and a large variety of exercises for each target muscle and for different equipment types.
   c. Email, and passwords will need to be secured.
   d. Users will be able to create a user account, and create, edit, and delete multiple workout templates based on the equipment available to them, their experience level, and their fitness goals.
   e. Users will start with creating an account, then having the option to obtain the required caloric requirements for their goals by inputting personal information like height, weight, age, etc. Then the user will complete a questionnaire that will eventually provide them a workout program specific to their responses to the questionnaire. The user will also have a dashboard where they can view and edit their workout template, search for additional exercises, and find video demonstrations for each exercise.
